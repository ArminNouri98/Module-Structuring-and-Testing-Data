// Predict and explain first...

function multiply(a, b) {// there is methode for multi of two numbers that it takes when they call it and it will shows
  // console.log(a * b);
  return a*b
}

// console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${multiply(10, 32)}`);///bug there is because you can not write console.log inside of console log
const result = multiply(10, 32); // Call the function and store the result in a variable
console.log(`The result of multiplying 10 and 32 is ${result}`); //
