//This line extracts the last two digits from the padded pence number string, which represent the pence, and ensures it has exactly two digits.
// For "399", the result is "99" (99 pence), while for "009", it would be "09" (9 pence).

// This program takes a string representing a price in pence
// The program then builds up a string representing the price in pounds

// You need to do a step-by-step breakdown of each line in this program
// Try and describe the purpose / rationale behind each step

// To begin, we can start with
// 1. const penceString = "399p": initialises a string variable with the value "399p"
