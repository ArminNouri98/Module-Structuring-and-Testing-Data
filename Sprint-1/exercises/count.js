let count = 0;

count = count + 1;

// Line 1 is a variable declaration, creating the count variable with an initial value of 0
// Describe what line 3 is doing, in particular focus on what = is doing

//Line 3 increments the variable count by 1. The = operator is used to assign the new value (which is the current value of count plus 1) back to count, effectively updating its value. This means that the previous value of count is replaced with the new value after the addition.
